					<h2>Rain</h2>
					<p>Drops tap upon the window. Weary tears roll down the glass, leaving
					small racetracks of moisture behind them. Tired eyes stare, awakened,
					out into the dreary grey, watching the strange dance. Longing hearts 
					beat faster in time with the cool wind, drumming water on their face.
					Sore feet leap with joy across the pavement; pain relieved by the 
					splashing of puddles on their skin.</p>
					<p>Downturned lips open into smiles to let out laughter and singing
					from long-silent throats. Blistered hands grasp at the clouds as their
					healing moisture falls to the earth. The sky weeps for the broken earth,
					and the Earth rejoices at its relief. For only a few moments, a few 
					pieces in time, a few pockets through life, the wind will blow away
					your worries, and the clouds will wash away your tears as it</p>
